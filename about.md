This is (hopefully) the location of a more permanent site than the last one I had. I had an unfortunate experience with a local hosting company that wiped out a dedicated server I was using to host my content. Although I had backups of the site, I couldn't find another hosting provider that would give me that great of a deal, and I didn't like the idea of paying a few bucks a month for a VPS just to host a site with some static content. I recently remembered "oh hey github pages!!" and figured that now was as good a time as any to set up my own site. 

My entire life feels like it has been spent on a computer, but as I grow older I find other things interesting. Dual sport motorcycling, heavy circuit training, bicycling (cx and road) along with my always wonderful wife and adopted red-nose pit Henry. 

I'm using Jekyll to host this, along with github pages as I previously mentioned.

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
