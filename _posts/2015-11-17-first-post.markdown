November 28th will mark five months of a ketogenic diet combined with high load circuit training.  

I wanted to quikly jot down some important numbers that I'd like to look back on in approx six more months. The two numbers I am most interested in are easily measured, as max weight at 1 rep for two very intense compound lifts. 

Deadlift: 275 lbs
Front Squat: 185 lbs

I originally started at around 150 lbs for my deadlift and 65 for the front squat. I have been attempting the deadlifts and squats 1x a week for the past three months as part of my training program. This is also on a 10% caloric deficit for the last five months.

I hope to be able to deadlift 200% of my body weight, and 150% of my weight on the squats in the next six months. I'm not sure how attainable that is though, as I am still running at a caloric deficit until I reach 160lbs. At that point I will begin eating "big" so I can work on increasting my numbers. At this point I am quite likely stalled due to the deficit. I still have 9lbs left to loose before making the decision to begin eating at a surplus.  

If you're looking for details on what exactly I eat daily, check out [MFP][mfplink] for daily breakdown. At some point I might upgrade to track more accurately when doing IF.
